# My Development Setup 

Hopefully this should be my development setup, including on Windows or Linux (Use either Mint or Ubuntu 18), 
The plan to have different setup for different projects, and hopefully this will be useful for someone else also in future.

Initial Data Gathering

1. Setup Visual Studio Code - with Python
``` Code
checkout this You Tube Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20 (learning in progress)
```

2. Setup a virtual environment - with Python, Anaconda
``` Code
(done something which I have forgotten - will dig up and update shortly)
``` 

3. Setup an environment for Data Science with Python - like in Coursera IBM Specialization
``` Code
(including Juypter Labs - not Jupyter notebooks, Apache Notebooks, R Studio, and something with Scala - I dont intend to use)
```
